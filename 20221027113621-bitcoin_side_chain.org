* [[https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/sidechains/][Sidechains]]
also called two-way pegged sidechains, are block chains whose native unit of currency is the same as another block chain.
In the context of bitcoin, sidechains use a mechanisim where
+ bitcoins are deposited into contract in the Bitcoin block chain
+ equal amount of bitcoin are created in the sidechain for spending
+ users on the sidechain can then:
  + send sidechain bitcoins to a special contract that destroys them
  + And release a corresponding amount of bitcoins previousely depositedon the contract on the Bitcoin block chain

** Federated sidechains
have depositors send their mainnet biticoin to a multisig contract controlled by a federation of signatories who also control the production of block on the sidechain
** Derivechains
are a type of proposed decentralized sidechains where depositors send their mainnet bitcoins into a contract controlled by anonymous Bitcoin miners who also control the block production on the side chain
