* Digital Signature
* Digital Signature provides the recipient the following:
** authentication
** non-repudiation
sender cannot deny  having sent the message
** integrity
* How are they created
** hash the data
** use private key to encrypt the hash, lets call it hash A
** the encrypted hash is the digital signature
* How are they verified
** decrypt the digital signature using public key of the sender
+ This will create the original hashed doc, hash A
+ next apply the same algorithm to hash, hash A  -> hash B
+ compare (hash A, hash B) are the same, then bob has verified the signature
